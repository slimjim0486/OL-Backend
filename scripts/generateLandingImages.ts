He wears large, round gold-framed glasses that make him look wise yet approachable. He has wavy purple hair, neatly styled, and wears a brown herringbone tweed jacket over a light blue shirt with a purple bow tie. His expression radiates kindness and enthusiasm - think of a favorite teacher everyone remembers fondly. He has a welcoming posture.

ENVIRONMENT: A cozy classroom with warm wooden floors, soft natural light streaming through large windows, and educational posters on the walls (shown as colorful shapes, not readable text). Potted plants add life to the space. Books are neatly arranged on shelves.
